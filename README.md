# Handwritten Text Recognition with Transformer OCR

This Python script utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library to perform Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) using the TrOCR (Transformer Optical Character Recognition) model for handwritten text. It captures images from an Android device's camera, processes them, and extracts text from the images.


This is trained with microsoft-tcocr model which is still in development as it can predict only one line.

Getting input from the mobile camera with help of ipweb cam.

Future idea:
Training a good model with good accuracy and making it as an app for recognizing handwritten text
